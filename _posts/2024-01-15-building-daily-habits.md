## The Habit Stack

Building a better life isn't about massive changes overnight. It's about tiny, consistent improvements that stack on top of each other. James Clear calls this the "1% rule" - if you improve by just 1% every day, you'll be 37 times better after a year.

The challenge most people face is that they don't understand the mechanics of habit formation. Your brain is a prediction machine. It's constantly looking for patterns and trying to conserve energy. When you repeat a behavior consistently, your brain automates it, moving it from conscious effort to unconscious routine.

## The Habit Loop

Every habit follows a simple loop:

1. **Cue** - The trigger that initiates the behavior
2. **Routine** - The behavior itself
3. **Reward** - The benefit you get from the behavior

To build a strong habit:

- **Start small.** Don't try to meditate for an hour. Start with 2 minutes.
- **Stack habits.** Attach new habits to existing ones. Exercise after coffee.
- **Track progress.** What gets measured gets managed.
- **Remove friction.** Make the desired behavior easy and the undesired behavior hard.

## The Compounding Effect

The real magic of habits is in the compounding. Every day you show up, you're not just building that one habit - you're building identity. You become the type of person who exercises, who reads, who learns.

When you own that identity, the habit becomes effortless.
