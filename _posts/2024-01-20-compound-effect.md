## The Mathematics of Growth

One percent per day might seem insignificant. But if you improve 1% daily for a year, you don't end up 1% better. You end up 37 times better.

This is the power of compounding. It's not linear - it's exponential.

## Why Consistency Beats Intensity

Most people understand this intellectually, but they don't believe it. So they try to make dramatic changes. They go on crash diets. They do 2-hour gym sessions after months of nothing. They try to write a novel in a month.

These approaches fail because they're unsustainable. You can't maintain intensity. You can maintain consistency.

## Real Compound Examples

- **Writing:** 500 words per day compounds into 200,000 words per year (multiple books)
- **Reading:** 30 minutes per day is 11,000+ pages per year
- **Learning:** 15 minutes daily learning compounds into deep expertise
- **Fitness:** 30 minutes of exercise 5x per week compounds into an incredible physique
- **Relationships:** Small acts of care compound into deep trust

## The Invisible Phase

Here's the hard part: the first 90 days look like nothing is happening. You're 1% better, then 2% better, then 3% better. It's invisible. Your brain wants to quit.

This is why discipline matters. You do the thing when you can't see results yet.

Then, around 6-9 months, people start noticing. Your results become visible. But by then, the compound is already in motion.

## Your Advantage

If you can be consistent while others quit during the invisible phase, you'll win. It's that simple.
