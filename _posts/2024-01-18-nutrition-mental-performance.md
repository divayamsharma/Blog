## The Gut-Brain Connection

Your gut is often called your "second brain," and for good reason. The food you eat directly impacts your neurotransmitter production, inflammation levels, and cognitive performance.

When you're running on poor nutrition, your brain is literally running on low fuel. You can't expect peak performance from a system that's starved of nutrients.

## What Modern Diets Get Wrong

The standard Western diet is optimized for taste and convenience, not for human performance. Ultra-processed foods, seed oils, and refined sugars create inflammation in your body and impair your cognitive function.

The irony? Optimal nutrition isn't complicated:

- **Eat real food** - Not food-like products
- **Prioritize protein** - Essential for neurotransmitter production
- **Include healthy fats** - Your brain is largely made of fat
- **Focus on whole carbs** - Not refined carbs
- **Get enough micronutrients** - Vegetables, not supplements alone

## The Energy-Performance Link

Your energy levels throughout the day are largely determined by nutrition choices. Blood sugar crashes lead to mental fog, poor decision-making, and reduced productivity.

A stable eating pattern - with adequate protein, fiber, and whole foods - keeps your energy and mental performance consistent.

## Simple Nutrition Framework

You don't need to be perfect. You need consistency:

1. **Protein at every meal** - 25-40g is optimal for most people
2. **Vegetables with every meal** - Fiber and micronutrients
3. **Minimize processed foods** - Focus on whole foods 80% of the time
4. **Stay hydrated** - Dehydration impairs cognitive function
